The Collector Simulator
=======================

The Collector Simulator is a sandbox video game envisioned by [Hedgehogs4Me](https://github.com/Hedgehogs4Me)
and later developed and published by [Hedgehogs4Me](https://github.com/Hedgehogs4Me) and [aude](https://github.com/aude).
The explorative and infinite aspects of The Collector Simulator enable players to
explore constructions out of textured tiles in a 2D procedurally generated world.
